Create a list of 20 random elements, with values ranging from 1 to 100. Store all the 
multiples of 2, all the multiples of 3 and all the multiples of 6 in separate lists. If a 
number is a multiple of 6, it shouldnâ€™t appear in the multiples of 2 or multiples of 3 lists. 
Print out all three multiples lists, as well as the list of remaining elements, that are not a 
multiple of any of the three. Output the results in ascending order. Feel free to use the 
inbuilt sorting functions
